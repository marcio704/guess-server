# Guess-Server

This project is part of a multi-thread/web-socket guessing game app. The guess-server is the server-side application which is responsible for generate a randomized number and inform the players (clients) whether the number they are guessing is right or not.

The players are generated by a multi-thread app called Guess-Client (found [here](https://github.com/marcio704/guess-client)).

Each player is represented by a thread which recursively generates a random number and send the guess via web-socket to the server app. The moment a player find the right number, the server stops the game and all the other players stop playing.
